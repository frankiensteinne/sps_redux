# Scissors-Paper-Rock Redux

## Project Introduction 
- The main objective of this project is to culminate all learnings (so far) with the Python programming course.
- This project utilizes the Python Programming Language. No other dependencies.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Use of Python, Docustrings and Commenting
- Ability to google the correct questions and asking the proper questions to get desired answer

## Challenges Faced
- I had difficulty with making the game modes a dictionary as I was unsure how to call them properly.
- I wanted to create a dynamic game wherein if you want to change or add game modes, you only need to modify the said dictionary.

## Learning and Growth 
-I was able to visualize my data structure and implement a code to call them effectively.

## Conclusion
- The SPS redux is a great project to showcase different applications of my (so far) 14-day Python journey.
